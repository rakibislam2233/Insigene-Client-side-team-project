            After working in academia for many years, Anthony Bosco, Denise
            Anderson, Edgar Basto, and James Read were interested in combining
            the exciting discovery research performed in academia with a more
            agile, focused, and flexible way of working that is provided by a
            startup company. They approached Nick Bosco with a proposal to build
            a company that was designed by researchers to provide support for
            other researchers.{" "}
