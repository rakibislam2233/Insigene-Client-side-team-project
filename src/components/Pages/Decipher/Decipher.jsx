            Decipher identifies novel therapeutic targets from human or mouse
            single cell mRNA expression data. Bulk mRNA expression data can be
            used to strengthen the analysis.
          </p>
          <p>
            Decipher enables you to go from raw sequencing data to
            experimentally validated, novel therapeutic targets within 12
            months.
          </p>
          <p>
            Decipher can be applied to experimental data examining interactions
            between cells including:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Dendritic cells and CD8 T cells to develop cancer immunotherapies
            </li>
            <li>
              Cancer, immune, and stromal cells to interrogate the tumor
              microenvironment
            </li>
            <li>
              Airway epithelial cells and immune cells to study respiratory
              diseases
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            While Decipher is a disease-agnostic algorithm, our team pairs
            Decipher with human expertise including expert domain knowledge and
            pre-clinical insights to achieve optimal results.

            Cells communicate by sending and receiving molecular messages or
            signals. For example, ligands produced by sender cells are often
            received by receptors on receiver cells. The exchange of molecular
            messages between cells triggers intracellular signaling cascades
            within cells that converge on transcription factors (TF), which in
            turn bind to regulatory regions in the DNA sequence to activate the
            expression of downstream target genes (TG). A regulon is the
            complete set of target genes that is driven by a given transcription
            factor.
          </p>
          <p>
            Decipher works by building 2 types of molecular networks: 1)
            ligand-receptor mediated cell-to-cell communication networks
            operating between cells, and 2) gene regulatory networks between TF
            and inferred TG operating within cells, then finding ligand-receptor
            signals that predict the activity of TF-TG networks.
